### Tree Structure Rendering and State Management

This documentation provides an overview of the architecture and detailed explanation of
how state and DOM are managed and kept in sync in the tree structure rendering system.

#### Architecture Overview

The system is composed of several classes and functions, each with specific
responsibilities:

1. **TreeNode**

   - Represents a single node in the tree.
   - Stores data about the node, its children, parent, and references to its DOM elements.

1. **Tree**

   - Manages a collection of tree nodes.

1. **TreeStateManager**

   - Manages the selection state of the nodes.
   - Provides methods to toggle selection, update the selection state of children and
     parents, and retrieve selected items.

1. **TreeNodeRenderer**

   - Handles rendering of individual nodes and updating their DOM state.
   - Manages event listeners for checkboxes and other interactive elements.

1. **TreeRenderer**

   - Manages the overall tree rendering.
   - Uses `TreeNodeRenderer` to render each node.
   - Injects CSS for tree styling.

1. **Standalone Functions**

   - `defaultNodeTemplate`, `defaultGetChevron`, and `defaultGetIcon` provide default
     rendering logic for nodes, chevrons, and icons, respectively.

### Detailed Explanation

#### Initialization and Rendering

1. **Tree and Node Initialization**

   - A tree is initialized with a collection of `TreeNode` instances.
   - Each `TreeNode` instance contains data about itself and references to its children,
     parent, and associated DOM elements.

1. **TreeRenderer Initialization**

   - `TreeRenderer` is initialized with a `Tree` instance, a container element, and
     options for rendering.
   - Default rendering functions (`defaultNodeTemplate`, `defaultGetChevron`,
     `defaultGetIcon`) are provided if not specified in the options.

1. **Rendering the Tree**

   - The `render` method of `TreeRenderer` clears the container element and iterates
     through the nodes in the tree, calling `renderNode` for each one.
   - `renderNode` creates a `TreeNodeRenderer` instance for each node, which handles the
     rendering of the node and its children.

#### TreeNodeRenderer and DOM Management

1. **Node Rendering**

   - `TreeNodeRenderer` creates the DOM elements for a node using the `nodeTemplate`
     function.
   - The generated template is inserted into the parent element.
   - References to the DOM elements are stored in the `TreeNode` instance.

1. **Updating Checkbox State**

   - `updateCheckboxState` ensures the checkbox state in the DOM matches the state managed
     by `TreeStateManager`.
   - This method is called recursively for all children of the node.

1. **Event Listeners Setup**

   - Event listeners for checkboxes, chevrons, and labels are set up in
     `setupEventListeners`.
   - These listeners handle user interactions, such as selecting a node or toggling a
     folder's visibility.

#### State Management and Synchronization

1. **Toggle Selection**

   - When a checkbox is clicked, the `toggleSelection` method of `TreeStateManager` is
     called.
   - This method updates the selection state of the node and propagates the changes to its
     children and parent.
   - `setNodeSelectionState` updates the state for a node.
   - `updateChildrenSelection` and `updateParentSelection` ensure the state of all related
     nodes is consistent.

1. **Reflecting State Changes in DOM**

   - After updating the state in `TreeStateManager`, the DOM is updated to reflect these
     changes.
   - `updateCheckboxState` is called to sync the DOM with the new state.
   - The checkboxes' `checked` and `indeterminate` properties are updated based on the
     state stored in `TreeStateManager`.

### Example Walkthrough

Consider the following scenario:

- The user clicks a checkbox for `childNode2`.

1. **Event Listener Triggered**

   - The checkbox click triggers the `change` event listener set up in `TreeNodeRenderer`.

1. **Toggle Selection**

   - The event listener calls `this.stateManager.toggleSelection(node)`.

1. **Update State**

   - `toggleSelection` updates the state for `childNode2` and propagates the change to its
     children (if any) and its parent (`rootNode`).
   - `setNodeSelectionState`, `updateChildrenSelection`, and `updateParentSelection`
     methods ensure that all related nodes have their states updated accordingly.

1. **Reflect Changes in DOM**

   - `updateCheckboxState` is called to update the checkboxes' `checked` and
     `indeterminate` properties based on the new state.

### Conclusion

By clearly separating the responsibilities across different classes and functions, the
system ensures a modular and maintainable approach to tree rendering and state management.
The `TreeNodeRenderer` focuses on rendering individual nodes and managing their state,
while the `TreeRenderer` handles the overall tree structure. The `TreeStateManager`
ensures that the state of the tree is consistent and correctly reflected in the DOM.
Standalone functions for default rendering logic keep the codebase clean and flexible.
